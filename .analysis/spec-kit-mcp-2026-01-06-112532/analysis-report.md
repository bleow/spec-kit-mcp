## Instructions for AI Agent

This workspace has been prepared for comprehensive project analysis. Please:

1. **Read the file-manifest.json** to understand project structure
2. **Detect technology stack** from indicator files (package.json, *.csproj, etc.)
3. **Generate inclusion/exclusion rules** based on detected technology
   - Example: .NET projects exclude bin/, obj/, packages/
   - Example: Node.js projects exclude node_modules/, dist/, build/
4. **Categorize files by priority**:
   - Critical: package files, entry points, configs
   - Important: main source code
   - Supporting: tests, docs, scripts
5. **Read files based on priority and size**:
   - Full read: <100KB or critical files
   - Sampled: 100KB-1MB (first + last portions)
   - Metadata only: >1MB or binary files
6. **Generate comprehensive analysis** including:
   - Technology stack and versions
   - Project structure and architecture
   - Dependencies and their health
   - Code quality indicators
   - Modernization recommendations
   - Feasibility assessment (inline upgrade vs greenfield rewrite)
